# go

1. go is fast, statically typed (variable types are checked by compiler), compiled language (compiled to machine code), strongly typed language(can't change var type in future)
2. general purpose programming lang
3. built-in testing support
4. object oriented language

### ok ? 

1. if declared and not use -> error 
2. usually entry point is main.go
3. In Go, a directory is a package, and a package can only have one function with a given name (with the exception of init(), which is a special case)
4. no while loop
